# Asset Types and Classification

## 🎯 What is an Asset?

**Definition**: A resource controlled by the company as a result of past events, from which future economic benefits are expected to flow.

**Three Criteria**:
1. ✅ Company **controls** it (legally owns or has rights to use)
2. ✅ Results from **past event** (already acquired, not just planned)
3. ✅ **Future economic benefit** expected (will generate revenue or reduce costs)

## 📂 Two Main Classifications

### Based on Time Horizon

    A[Assets] --> B[Current Assets]
    A --> C[Non-Current Assets]
    
    B --> B1[Expected to be converted<br/>to cash or consumed<br/>within ONE YEAR]
    C --> C1[Provide benefits<br/>BEYOND ONE YEAR]
    
    B --> B2[Examples:<br/>• Cash<br/>• Inventory<br/>• Accounts Receivable<br/>• Prepaid Expenses]
    
    C --> C2[Examples:<br/>• Property, Plant & Equipment<br/>• Land<br/>• Long-term Investments<br/>• Intangible Assets]

## 💵 Current Assets

### Characteristics
- **High liquidity** (easily converted to cash)
- **Short-term** nature (consumed/converted within 1 year)
- **Operating cycle** - used in day-to-day operations

### Types of Current Assets

#### 1. Cash and Cash Equivalents
- Physical currency
- Bank account balances
- Short-term investments (< 3 months maturity)

**Example**: Ben's coffee shop has €1,300 in the bank.

#### 2. Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables)
- Money owed BY customers
- Sales made on credit, not yet paid

**Example**: Ben sells €500 of coffee to a corporate client, payment due in 30 days.

#### 3. Inventory
- Goods held for sale
- Raw materials for production
- Work in progress
- Finished goods

**Example**: Ben's €100 worth of coffee beans waiting to be used.

#### 4. Prepaid Expenses
- Payments made in advance for future benefits
- Insurance paid upfront
- Rent paid in advance

**Example**: Ben pays €1,200 for annual insurance on January 1st.

### Current Asset Flow

```mermaid

    A[Cash] --> B[Purchase Inventory]
    B --> C[Inventory]
    C --> D[Sell to Customers]
    D --> E[Accounts Receivable]
    E --> F[Customer Pays]
    F --> A
    
    style A fill:#d4edda
```

This is called the **Operating Cycle** or **Working Capital Cycle**.

## 🏗️ Non-Current Assets (Fixed Assets)

### Characteristics
- **Low liquidity** (not easily converted to cash)
- **Long-term** use (benefits beyond one year)
- **Not for resale** (used in operations)

### Types of Non-Current Assets

#### 1. Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)

**Tangible assets** used in operations:

| Asset Type | Life Span | Example |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Land | Infinite | Shop location |
| Buildings | 20-50 years | Coffee shop premises |
| Machinery | 5-15 years | Espresso machine |
| Vehicles | 3-10 years | Delivery van |
| Furniture | 5-10 years | Tables and chairs |
| Computers | 3-5 years | POS system |

**Example**: Ben's €500 espresso machine expected to last 5 years.

#### 2. Intangible Assets

**Non-physical assets** with value:

- **Patents**: Exclusive rights to inventions
- **Trademarks**: Brand names and logos  
- **Copyrights**: Rights to creative works
- **Goodwill**: Premium paid in acquisitions
- **Software**: Computer programs

**Example**: If Ben franchises his coffee shop, the franchise rights would be an intangible asset.

#### 3. Long-term Investments

- Investments held longer than one year
- Stocks in other companies
- Long-term bonds

## 🔄 How Assets Get "Used Up"

Different asset types are consumed differently:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Asset Types] --> B[Current Assets]
    A --> C[Non-Current Assets]
    
    B --> D[Consumed Quickly]
    D --> D1[Inventory → Cost of Goods Sold]
    D --> D2[Prepaid Exp → Operating Expense]
    
    C --> E[Consumed Over Time]
    E --> E1[PP&E → Depreciation]
    E --> E2[Intangibles → Amortization]
    E --> E3[Natural Resources → Depletion]
    
    style D1 fill:#ffe1e1
    style E1 fill:#ffe1e1
```

### Consumption Patterns

**Current Assets - Direct Consumption**:
- Buy coffee beans for €500 (Asset: Inventory)
- Use €400 worth (Expense: Cost of Goods Sold)
- Remaining €100 (Still Asset: Inventory)

**Non-Current Assets - Gradual Consumption**:
- Buy machine for €600 (Asset: Equipment)
- Useful life: 60 months
- Monthly depreciation: €10 (Expense: Depreciation)
- After 6 months: Asset shows €540 (€600 - €60)

## 🔍 Asset Quality Analysis

Not all assets are equally valuable! Consider:

### High-Quality Assets ✅
- **Liquid**: Easily converted to cash (cash, marketable securities)
- **Productive**: Generate revenue (machinery in use)
- **Current**: Up-to-date technology (modern equipment)

### Lower-Quality Assets ⚠️
- **Illiquid**: Hard to sell (specialized equipment)
- **Idle**: Not being used (spare machines)
- **Obsolete**: Outdated technology (old computers)

### Red Flags 🚩
- **Overvalued inventory**: Goods that won't sell
- **Impaired equipment**: Damaged or broken assets
- **Uncollectible receivables**: Customers who won't pay

## 📊 Asset Composition Analysis

```mermaid
pie title Ben's Asset Mix
    "Current Assets (67%)" : 67
    "Non-Current Assets (33%)" : 33
```

```mermaid
pie title Anna's Asset Mix
    "Current Assets (38%)" : 38
    "Non-Current Assets (62%)" : 62
```

**Insight**: Anna has more invested in long-term assets (bigger machine), while Ben has more liquidity (current assets).

## 🎯 Why Classification Matters

### For Different Stakeholders:

**Banks/Creditors** 🏦:
- Focus on **current assets** (can you pay short-term debts?)
- Look at **liquidity ratios**
- Want to see: Current Assets > Current Liabilities

**Investors** 📈:
- Look at **asset efficiency** (generating revenue from assets?)
- Assess **asset quality** (valuable or obsolete?)
- Consider **growth potential** (investing in new PP&E?)

**Management** 👔:
- Monitor **working capital** (current assets - current liabilities)
- Plan **capital expenditures** (new non-current assets)
- Optimize **asset utilization**

## 🔄 The Asset Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Acquisition: Purchase or Create
    Acquisition --> InUse: Put into Service
    InUse --> InUse: Depreciate/Use
    InUse --> Disposal: Sell/Scrap
    Disposal --> [*]
    
    note right of Acquisition
        Recorded at cost
        on Balance Sheet
    end note
    
    note right of InUse
        Systematically depreciated
        Expense recognized
    end note
    
    note right of Disposal
        Remove from books
        Recognize gain/loss
    end note
```

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **Current assets** = converted to cash within 1 year (liquid)
2. **Non-current assets** = used beyond 1 year (fixed)
3. Different assets are **consumed differently**:
   - Inventory → Direct expense when sold
   - PP&E → Depreciation over time
4. **Asset quality matters** as much as quantity
5. **Classification affects** how stakeholders evaluate the company
6. The **operating cycle** shows how current assets flow

## 📝 Practice Questions

1. Is prepaid insurance a current or non-current asset? Why?
2. A company buys a truck for €30,000. Is this current or non-current?
3. Why might a company with €1M in assets still go bankrupt?
4. What's more valuable: €100K in cash or €100K in specialized equipment?

**Answers**:
1. Current (will be consumed within 1 year as insurance coverage is used)
2. Non-current (provides benefits beyond 1 year)
3. If all assets are non-current and they have immediate debt obligations (liquidity crisis)
4. Depends on context, but cash is more liquid and universally valuable
