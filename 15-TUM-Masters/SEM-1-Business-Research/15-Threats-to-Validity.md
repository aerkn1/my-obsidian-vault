# Threats to Validity in Experiments

## 🎯 What Can Go Wrong?

Understanding threats helps design better studies and interpret results critically.

## ⚠️ Threats to Internal Validity

### 1. History
**External events** during study affect results

**Example**: Economic crisis during job satisfaction study
**Control**: Use control group, same time period

### 2. Maturation
Participants change **naturally** over time

**Example**: Children get older, smarter (not due to treatment)
**Control**: Control group, shorter duration

### 3. Testing
**Taking pretest** affects posttest scores

**Example**: Practice effects, learning test format
**Control**: No pretest, or control group gets same tests

### 4. Instrumentation
**Measurement changes** over time

**Example**: Raters become stricter/lenient
**Control**: Calibration, automated measurement

### 5. Regression to Mean
**Extreme scores** move toward average

**Example**: Select worst performers → improve anyway
**Control**: Don't select extremes, use control group

### 6. Selection Bias
Groups **differ before** treatment

**Example**: Volunteers vs. non-volunteers differ
**Control**: Random assignment

### 7. Attrition/Mortality
**Differential dropout** between groups

**Example**: Difficult treatment → more dropouts
**Control**: Intention-to-treat analysis, check differences

### 8. Diffusion
**Treatment leaks** to control group

**Example**: Control group learns about treatment
**Control**: Separate groups, attention placebo

## 🌍 Threats to External Validity

### 1. Sample Characteristics
Results don't generalize to other **people**

**Example**: College students ≠ general population
**Solution**: Diverse samples, replicate

### 2. Setting
Results don't generalize to other **contexts**

**Example**: Lab ≠ real workplace
**Solution**: Field studies, realistic conditions

### 3. Time
Results don't generalize to other **time periods**

**Example**: 1990s results ≠ 2020s
**Solution**: Replication over time

### 4. Treatment Variations
Results don't generalize to other **implementations**

**Example**: Specific trainer, specific materials
**Solution**: Vary implementation, multiple sites

## 🎭 Other Validity Threats

### Hawthorne Effect
Behave differently **because being observed**

**Solution**: Concealment, naturalistic observation

### Experimenter Expectancy
Researcher bias **influences** results

**Solution**: Double-blind procedures

### Demand Characteristics
Participants **guess hypothesis** and comply

**Solution**: Cover story, between-subjects design

## ✅ Control Strategies

| Threat | Best Control |
|--------|--------------|
| History | Control group |
| Maturation | Control group, shorter study |
| Testing | No pretest, control group |
| Selection | Random assignment |
| Attrition | Check differences, ITT analysis |
| Hawthorne | Concealment |
| Demand | Between-subjects, cover story |

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **Internal validity** threatens causal claims
2. **External validity** threatens generalization
3. **Random assignment** solves many internal threats
4. **Control group** essential for most threats
5. **Multiple threats** often present
6. **Perfect study impossible** - balance trade-offs
