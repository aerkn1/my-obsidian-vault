- Critical case
- Longitudinal study

### Multiple Case
- Comparison across cases
- Replication logic
- More generalizable

---

## 📊 Data Sources

**Triangulation** using multiple sources:
- Interviews
- Documents
- Observations
- Archival records
- Physical artifacts

---

## 🔍 Analysis Strategies

### Pattern Matching
Compare patterns to predictions

### Explanation Building
Iterative causal explanation

### Time Series
Chronological tracing

---

## ✅ Generalization

**Analytical Generalization**: To theory (not population)

"This case supports/extends theory X"

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **Case study**: Deep dive into few cases
2. **Context matters**: Real-world setting
3. **Multiple sources**: Triangulate data
4. **Analytical**: Generalize to theory
5. **Qualitative**: Usually, but can include numbers
