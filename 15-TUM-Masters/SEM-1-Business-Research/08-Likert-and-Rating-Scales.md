# Likert Scales and Rating Methods

## 🎯 Understanding Likert Scales

The most common measurement tool in survey research.

## 📏 What is a Likert Scale?

**Definition**: Rating scale measuring agreement/disagreement

**Structure:**
- Statement presented
- Response options (typically 5 or 7)
- Ordered from negative to positive

**Example:**
"I feel satisfied with my job"
1. Strongly Disagree
2. Disagree
3. Neutral
4. Agree
5. Strongly Agree

## 🎨 Likert Scale Characteristics

### Properties

**1. Ordinal Level**
- Ordered categories
- Distances between points not necessarily equal
- But often treated as interval in practice

**2. Closed Response Options**
- Predefined choices
- Must select from given options

**3. Symmetric Scale**
- Equal positive and negative options
- Usually includes neutral midpoint

**4. Typical Length**
- 5-point: Most common
- 7-point: More discrimination
- 3-point: Quick, less precise

## 🔢 Number of Points Decision

### 5-Point Scale

**Use when:**
✅ General attitudes
✅ Quick assessment
✅ Phone surveys
✅ Broader categorization

**Example:**
1. Strongly Disagree
2. Disagree
3. Neutral
4. Agree
5. Strongly Agree

---

### 7-Point Scale

**Use when:**
✅ Need more precision
✅ Sophisticated respondents
✅ Detailed measurement
✅ Statistical analysis planned

**Example:**
1. Strongly Disagree
2. Disagree
3. Somewhat Disagree
4. Neutral
5. Somewhat Agree
6. Agree
7. Strongly Agree

## 🎭 To Include Midpoint or Not?

### With Midpoint (Odd Number)

**Advantages:**
✅ Allows genuine neutrality
✅ Less frustrating for respondents
✅ Captures true "don't know"

**Disadvantages:**
❌ People may hide in middle
❌ Less discriminating

---

### Without Midpoint (Even Number)

**Advantages:**
✅ Forces direction
✅ More discriminating
✅ No fence-sitting

**Disadvantages:**
❌ Frustrates truly neutral respondents
❌ May get random answers

## 📊 Other Rating Scale Types

### Semantic Differential Scale

**Structure**: Bipolar adjectives with scale between

**Example:**
Our service is:
- Slow 1--2--3--4--5--6--7 Fast
- Expensive 1--2--3--4--5--6--7 Affordable
- Complicated 1--2--3--4--5--6--7 Simple

**Use**: Measuring connotative meaning, brand perception

---

### Guttman Scale

**Structure**: Hierarchical/cumulative items

**Logic**: Agreeing with item N means agreeing with items 1 to N-1

**Example**: Ability assessment
- □ I can walk
- □ I can jog
- □ I can run
- □ I can sprint

---

### Visual Analog Scale (VAS)

**Structure**: Continuous line, mark position

**Example:**
No Pain |_________________| Extreme Pain

**Use**: Medical research, subjective feelings

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Direction

Keep all items same direction OR use reverse-coded items deliberately

❌ Mix: "I am satisfied" + "I am dissatisfied"
✅ Better: All positive or note reverse items

---

### 2. Clear Labels

Label ALL points or at least endpoints

❌ Unclear: 1---2---3---4---5
✅ Clear: 1(Strongly Disagree)---3(Neutral)---5(Strongly Agree)

---

### 3. Balanced Scale

Equal positive and negative options

❌ Unbalanced: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor (3 positive, 1 negative)
✅ Balanced: Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **Likert scales**: Most common survey measurement
2. **Ordinal level**: Ordered but not equal intervals
3. **5 or 7 points**: Most common lengths
4. **Midpoint debate**: Odd vs. even number of options
5. **Consistency matters**: Same direction, clear labels
6. **Multiple types**: Likert, semantic differential, Guttman
