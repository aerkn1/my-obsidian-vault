**Disadvantages:**
❌ Time-consuming to analyze
❌ Requires coding
❌ Lower response rates
❌ Variable response quality

**When to Use:**
- Exploratory research
- Pilot studies
- Qualitative data needed
- Don't know answer options

**Advantages:**
✅ Easy to analyze
✅ Quick to answer

## ✍️ Writing Good Questions

### The Golden Rules

**1. Be Specific and Precise**

❌ Bad: "Do you like this product?"
✅ Good: "How satisfied are you with the product's durability? (1-7)"

**2. Avoid Double-Barreled Questions**

❌ Bad: "Are you satisfied with price and quality?"
✅ Good: Two separate questions

**3. Use Simple Language**

❌ Bad: "To what extent do you utilize technological solutions?"
✅ Good: "How often do you use technology?"

**4. Avoid Leading Questions**

❌ Bad: "Don't you agree remote work is better?"
✅ Good: "What is your opinion on remote work?"

**5. Provide Mutually Exclusive Options**

❌ Bad: Age ranges overlap (20-30, 30-40)
✅ Good: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49
