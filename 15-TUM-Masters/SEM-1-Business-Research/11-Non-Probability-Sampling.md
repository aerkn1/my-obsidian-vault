# Non-Probability Sampling Methods in Detail

## 🎯 When Random Isn't Possible (or Necessary)

Non-probability sampling uses researcher judgment rather than random selection. Can't generalize statistically, but valuable for many research purposes.

---

## 🎨 Core Principle

**Selection based on JUDGMENT, not random chance**

Characteristics:
❌ Can't calculate sampling error
❌ Limited statistical generalization
✅ Practical for hard-to-reach populations
✅ Good for exploratory research
✅ Analytical generalization possible

---

## 1️⃣ Convenience Sampling

### Definition
Sample whoever is **easily accessible**

### Process
Simply recruit whoever is available and willing

### Examples
- Survey people at shopping mall
- Post survey on social media
- Use students in your class
- Amazon MTurk workers
- Friends and family

### Advantages
✅ Fast and cheap
✅ Easy to implement
✅ Good for pilot testing
✅ Better than no data

### Disadvantages
❌ Highly biased
❌ Can't generalize
❌ Unknown representativeness
❌ Self-selection issues

### When Acceptable
- **Pilot testing** instruments
- **Exploratory** preliminary research
- **Experiments** with random assignment (creates equivalence)
- **Concept testing** (not measurement)

### Example
Testing a new survey instrument:
- Post on department bulletin board
- First 50 people who respond
- Check if questions make sense
- NOT for drawing conclusions about population

---

## 2️⃣ Quota Sampling

### Definition
Non-random selection to meet **predetermined quotas** for subgroups

### Process
1. Determine desired subgroup representation
2. Set quotas for each subgroup
3. Recruit until quotas filled
4. **No random selection** within quotas

### Example
Survey shoppers to represent population:
- Need 200 total
- Quota: 100 men, 100 women
- Quota: 50 age 18-30, 50 age 31-50, 50 age 51-70, 50 age 70+
- Recruit at mall until all quotas filled

### Advantages
✅ Ensures representation
✅ More practical than stratified random
✅ Can control important characteristics
✅ Quick

### Disadvantages
❌ Selection bias within quotas
❌ Interviewer chooses who to approach
❌ Can't calculate sampling error
❌ May not be representative

### Quota vs. Stratified
Both divide into subgroups, BUT:
- **Quota**: Non-random selection within groups
- **Stratified**: Random selection within groups

## 3️⃣ Purposive/Judgment Sampling

### Definition
Researcher **deliberately selects** "information-rich" cases

### Types

**A. Typical Case Sampling**
Select "average" or "representative" cases

**Example**: Study typical startup
- Not extreme success or failure
- Medium-sized team
- Common industry

**B. Extreme/Deviant Case Sampling**
Select unusual or outlier cases

**Example**: Study extreme startup success
- Unicorn companies
- Understand what makes them special

**C. Critical Case Sampling**
"If it works here, it will work anywhere"

**Example**: Test training program
- At worst-performing location
- If it works there, should work everywhere

**D. Homogeneous Sampling**
Select similar cases for focused analysis

**Example**: Study only female CEOs in tech
- Reduce variation
- Focus on specific experience

**E. Maximum Variation Sampling**
Select diverse cases to capture range

**Example**: Study organizational culture
- Small startups, large corporations
- Tech, manufacturing, service sectors
- Capture full spectrum

### Advantages
✅ Gets relevant information
✅ Efficient with limited resources
✅ Good for qualitative research
✅ Focuses on information-rich cases

### Disadvantages
❌ Researcher bias
❌ No statistical generalization
❌ Subjective selection
❌ Unknown representativeness

## 4️⃣ Snowball Sampling

### Definition
Participants **recruit** additional participants from their networks

### Process
1. Identify initial participants ("seeds")
2. Ask them to refer others who meet criteria
3. Referred people refer more
4. Continue until target size reached

### Visual Growth
```
Person 1 (seed)
  ├─ Refers Person 2
  ├─ Refers Person 3
  └─ Refers Person 4
       ├─ Refers Person 5
       ├─ Refers Person 6
       └─ Refers Person 7
            ├─ Refers Person 8
            └─ ...
```

### When to Use
- **Hidden populations**: Drug users, illegal immigrants
- **Rare characteristics**: Rare disease patients
- **Tight-knit communities**: Religious groups
- **Sensitive topics**: Whistleblowers, victims

### Example
Study of undocumented immigrants:
- Initial contact through community organization
- Ask to refer others in similar situation
- Build sample through referrals

### Advantages
✅ Access hidden/hard-to-reach populations
✅ Builds trust through referrals
✅ Low cost
✅ May be only feasible method

### Disadvantages
❌ Very biased (network effects)
❌ Not independent (people in same network)
❌ Hard to track sampling
❌ No statistical inference
❌ May miss isolated individuals

## 5️⃣ Theoretical Sampling

### Definition
Sampling driven by **emerging theory** (grounded theory approach)

### Process
1. Start with initial purposive sample
2. Collect and analyze data
3. Theory begins to emerge
4. Sample additional cases to test/refine theory
5. Continue until **theoretical saturation**

### Theoretical Saturation
**Stop when**: New data adds no new insights

### Example
Study of entrepreneurial failure:

**Round 1** (n=5):
- Interview failed founders
- Pattern: Funding issues mentioned

**Round 2** (n=5):
- Purposely sample cases with funding problems
- Confirm pattern, new insight: timing matters

**Round 3** (n=5):
- Sample failed ventures at different times
- Theory: Funding + market timing interaction

**Round 4** (n=3):
- No new insights → Stop (saturation reached)

### Advantages
✅ Theory-driven, responsive
✅ Efficient for theory building
✅ Flexible
✅ Deep theoretical insights

### Disadvantages
❌ No statistical generalization
❌ Time-intensive
❌ Requires concurrent analysis
❌ Subjective stopping point

---

## 6️⃣ Expert Sampling

### Definition
Sample only **experts or key informants**

### Process
Identify and recruit people with specialized knowledge

### Example
Study of AI implementation:
- Interview CTOs of major tech companies
- Sample ML researchers
- Talk to AI ethics experts

### Advantages
✅ High-quality information
✅ Efficient
✅ Authoritative insights

### Disadvantages
❌ May have bias
❌ Not representative of general population
❌ Limited perspectives

| **Convenience** | Availability | Pilot testing | High bias |
| **Quota** | Quotas met | Quick subgroup data | Selection bias |
| **Purposive** | Information-rich | Qualitative research | Subjective |
