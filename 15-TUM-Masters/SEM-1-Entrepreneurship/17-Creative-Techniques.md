## ✅ Valid Creative Techniques

### 1️⃣ Analogical Reasoning
**Definition**: Transfer solutions from one domain to another

**Process:**
```
Problem in Domain A
    ↓
Find Similar Problem in Domain B
    ↓
Adapt Solution from B to A
```

**Examples:**
- **Velcro** ← Burdock burrs sticking to clothes
- **Airplane wing** ← Bird wing structure  
- **Sonar** ← Bat echolocation
- **Packaging** ← Nature's protective shells

**How to Use:**
1. Define your problem
2. Look for analogies in nature, other industries
3. Adapt the solution

---

### 2️⃣ Conceptual Combination
**Definition**: Merge two or more concepts to create something new

**Formula:**
```
Concept A + Concept B = New Innovation
```

**Examples:**
- **Smartphone** = Phone + Computer
- **Podcast** = Radio + On-demand
- **Airbnb** = Hotel + Home sharing
- **Uber** = Taxi + App technology
- **Smart Watch** = Watch + Fitness tracker + Phone

**How to Use:**
1. List two existing concepts
2. Brainstorm how to combine them
3. Identify unique value proposition

### 3️⃣ WIBNI (Wouldn't It Be Nice If...)
**Definition**: Dream-based ideation starting with ideal scenarios

**Process:**
```
"Wouldn't it be nice if..."
    ↓
Generate wild ideas
    ↓
Find feasible versions
```

**Examples:**
- WIBNI... you could order food without calling? → Food delivery apps
- WIBNI... you could work from anywhere? → Cloud computing, Zoom
- WIBNI... you could pay with your phone? → Mobile payments
- WIBNI... homes could adjust temperature automatically? → Smart thermostats

**How to Use:**
1. Start with "Wouldn't it be nice if..."
2. No constraints - dream big
3. Later filter for feasibility
