## ⚡ MUST-KNOW FOR EXAM

### 🔴 Critical Frameworks

#### 1. Triple Bottom Line (TBL)
```
People (Social) + Planet (Ecological) + Profit (Economic)
NOT: Innovation, Performance, Technology
```

#### 2. Ansoff Matrix
```
                 EXISTING      NEW
                PRODUCTS    PRODUCTS
EXISTING    ┌──────────┬──────────┐
MARKETS     │Penetrate │ Product  │
            │          │   Dev    │
            ├──────────┼──────────┤
NEW         │ Market   │Diversify │
MARKETS     │   Dev    │          │
            └──────────┴──────────┘

NEW MARKET + EXISTING PRODUCT = Market Development
NEW PRODUCT + EXISTING MARKET = Product Development
```

#### 3. IOOI Framework
```
Input → Output → Outcome → IMPACT
                            ↑
                    (Long-term changes)
```

#### 4. Big Five (OCEAN)
```
O - Openness
C - Conscientiousness
E - Extraversion
A - Agreeableness
N - Neuroticism
NOT: Proactivity
```

## 🧠 Cognitive Biases - Quick Match

| Trigger Words | Bias |
|---------------|------|
| **RECENT**, memorable | Availability |
| **SMALL SAMPLE**, few attributes | Representativeness |
| **FIRST** information, initial number | Anchoring |
| Too **CERTAIN**, overestimate | Overconfidence |
| "I **KNEW IT**" | Hindsight |

---

## ⚖️ Effectuation vs Causation

| Question | Causation | Effectuation |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Starting point? | Goal | Means |
| Risk approach? | Maximize returns | Affordable loss |
| Relationships? | **TRANSACTIONAL** | **PARTNERSHIPS** |
| Surprises? | **AVOID** | **LEVERAGE** |
| Logic? | Predict future | Control future |

**KEY**: 
- Transactional = Causation
- Partnerships (Crazy Quilt) = Effectuation
- Avoiding surprises = Causation

---

## 🎲 Risk vs Uncertainty

**Main Difference**: **KNOWN PROBABILITIES**

```
RISK: Known probabilities → Can calculate EV
UNCERTAINTY: Unknown probabilities → Cannot calculate
```

---

## 👥 Team Dynamics

### Homogeneity
```
SHOULD be homogeneous:
✓ Values, Vision, Moral, Work Ethic

Should be DIVERSE:
✓ Competencies, Skills, Knowledge
```

### Conflicts
```
COGNITIVE (Task) → ENCOURAGE ✓
- About ideas, strategies
- Increases quality, innovation

AFFECTIVE (Relationship) → DISCOURAGE ✗
- Personal attacks
- Decreases trust, performance

ALL true:
- Relationship conflicts harm performance
- Task conflicts improve decisions
- Constructive communication prevents escalation
```

### Power Distribution Problems
```
All of the above:
- Overdominance of powerful members
- Capability mismatch (power ≠ competence)
- Perceived unfairness → conflicts
```

---

## 💼 Business Models

**Customers ≠ Users** = **MULTI-SIDED** Business Model

Examples:
- Google (Users = searchers, Customers = advertisers)
- Credit cards (Users = cardholders, Customers = merchants)
- Newspapers (Users = readers, Customers = advertisers)

---

## 📱 Social Business Models

### Social by Sourcing
**HOW** they make products/services
- Fair trade, employing disadvantaged

### Social by Selling
**WHAT** they sell or **TO WHOM**
- Affordable products to underserved

### Social by Profit Sharing
**WHERE** profits go
- Donations to charity

---

## 💰 Vesting

**Definition**: **DYNAMIC** way of splitting equity over time

```
Standard: 4 years, 1-year cliff, monthly after

Year 0 -------- Year 1 -------- Year 4
  0%             25%            100%
                  ↑
                Cliff
```

**NOT**: VC financing, equal split, just a contract

---

## 🎨 Creative Techniques

**Valid**:
- Analogical Reasoning
- Conceptual Combination
- WIBNI (Wouldn't It Be Nice If)

**NOT Valid**:
- Equation Method ❌

---

## 📊 Financing Sources

| Source | Ownership | Control | Best For |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Bank Loan | Keep 100% | Full | Prototype (if creditworthy) |
| VC | Lose equity | Lose control | Growth stage |
| Angel | Lose equity | Some control | Early stage |
| Crowdfunding (reward) | Keep 100% | Full | Validation |

**For Prototype + Keep Control**: Bank loan or reward crowdfunding

---

## 🎯 IMO Framework (Klotz et al.)

**Mediators**: Influence how **INPUTS** relate to **OUTCOMES**

```
INPUTS → MEDIATORS → OUTCOMES
(Skills,    (Processes,    (Performance,
 Knowledge)  Communication) Sales)

Mediators explain HOW/WHY inputs lead to outcomes
```

---

## 🏢 Franchising

**TRUE**: Use of **PROVEN FORMULA** for new entry

**FALSE**:
- Own franchisor's company
- Unique product
- Complete control

---

## 🏃 First vs Late Mover

**Late Mover Advantage**:
- **Lower uncertainty** (market/tech proven)
- Learn from first mover mistakes
- Better technology
- Lower R&D costs

**First Mover Advantage**:
- Brand recognition
- Customer loyalty
- Secure suppliers

---

## ✅ EXAM ANSWER PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: "All of the Above"
Often the correct answer when all statements are accurate

### Pattern 2: "NOT" Questions
Find what DOESN'T belong:
- TBL → NOT Innovation
- Big Five → NOT Proactivity
- Effectuation → NOT Transactional relationships
- Creative → NOT Equation method

### Pattern 3: Definitions
- Vesting = DYNAMIC (time-based)
- Customers ≠ Users = MULTI-SIDED
- Known probabilities = RISK
- Social by Sourcing = HOW made

## 🎯 Last-Minute Checklist

- [ ] Triple Bottom Line = People, Planet, Profit
- [ ] Ansoff: Market Dev = New market + Existing product
- [ ] Vesting = Dynamic equity split
- [ ] Effectuation ≠ Transactional relationships
- [ ] Risk vs Uncertainty = Known probabilities
- [ ] Cognitive conflict = Good; Affective = Bad

- [ ] Multi-sided = Customers ≠ Users
- [ ] Big Five = OCEAN (NOT Proactivity)
- [ ] IOOI: Impact = Long-term changes

## 📝 Common Exam Traps

❌ **TBL includes "Innovation"** → NO, only People/Planet/Profit
❌ **Vesting is a contract** → NO, it's a DYNAMIC mechanism
❌ **Effectuation uses transactions** → NO, uses PARTNERSHIPS
❌ **Risk = Uncertainty** → NO, different (probabilities)
❌ **Affective conflict is good** → NO, always harmful
❌ **Teams should be homogeneous in skills** → NO, DIVERSE
❌ **Customers always = Users** → NO, not in multi-sided
❌ **Product Dev = New market** → NO, NEW PRODUCT
❌ **Passion doesn't influence** → NO, it DOES influence
❌ **First mover always better** → NO, late has advantages too
