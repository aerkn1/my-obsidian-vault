## 🎯 Power in Entrepreneurial Teams

Power distribution refers to how influence and decision-making authority is distributed among team members. **Unequal power** can create serious problems.

---

## 🎓 Exam Question & Answer

### Question
**Unequal power distributions can lead to…**

a) Overdominance of more powerful team members such that contributions of less powerful team members are not sufficiently taken into consideration
b) A mismatch between those having power and those who would be most capable to address a problem
c) Perceived unfairness and the corresponding reduction of effort/emergence of conflicts
d) All of the above

**✅ ANSWER: (d)**

**Explanation**:
ALL three problems can result from unequal power:
- Overdominance silencing valuable input
- Power ≠ Competence mismatch
- Perceived unfairness causing conflicts

## ⚠️ Three Major Problems

### 1️⃣ Overdominance

**The Problem:**
```
HIGH POWER MEMBER
       ↓
  Dominates discussions
  Makes all decisions
  Talks most
       ↓
LOW POWER MEMBERS
       ↓
  Silenced
  Ideas ignored
  Disengaged
       ↓
   LOST VALUE
```

**Example:**
```
Founding Team:
• CEO (60% equity): Dominates every meeting
• CTO (20% equity): Good ideas but never heard
• CMO (20% equity): Stops contributing

Result: Lose valuable technical and marketing insights
```

**Consequences:**
- Miss important perspectives
- Lower quality decisions
- Team disengagement
- Talent leaves

---

### 2️⃣ Power ≠ Competence Mismatch

**The Problem:**
```
POWER based on:          COMPETENCE for problem:
• Equity ownership       • Technical expertise
• Founder status         • Market knowledge  
• Seniority             • Specific skills
       ↓                        ↓
    MISMATCH
       ↓
  WRONG PERSON DECIDES
```

**Example:**
```
Technical Decision Needed:
• CEO (non-technical) has power
• CTO (expert) has solution
• CEO overrules CTO
• Wrong technical decision made

Result: Product delays, technical debt
```

**Consequences:**
- Suboptimal decisions
- Expertise wasted
- Frustration of capable members
- Poor outcomes

---

### 3️⃣ Perceived Unfairness

**The Problem:**
```
POWER IMBALANCE
       ↓
"Why does their opinion matter more?"
"My contribution isn't valued"
"This isn't fair"
       ↓
DEMOTIVATION
       ↓
• Reduced effort
• Passive resistance
• Conflicts emerge
• Members exit
```

**Example:**
```
Equal work, unequal voice:
• Founder A: Works 60 hrs, 50% equity, veto power
• Founder B: Works 60 hrs, 20% equity, no real say
• Founder B: "Why should I work as hard?"

Result: Resentment, reduced effort, eventual split
```

**Consequences:**
- Lower motivation
- Increased conflicts
- Team breakdown
- Venture failure

## 📊 Power Sources

### Legitimate Power Sources
```
✓ Equity ownership
✓ Formal role (CEO, etc.)
✓ Expertise
✓ Network/connections
✓ Track record
✓ Resource control
```

### Problems Arise When:
```
❌ Power source ≠ Decision relevance
❌ Historical power persists when irrelevant
❌ Structural power (equity) overrides expertise
❌ Personality dominates competence
```

---

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Apple - Jobs Returns
```
1997: Steve Jobs returns
Power Dynamic:
• Jobs: Co-founder, visionary, but ousted earlier
• Board: Had removed him before
• New CEO: In place

Jobs' Power: Charisma + Vision + Track record
Result: Took control, transformed company

This worked because:
✓ Power = Competence for vision
✓ Team aligned with direction
```

---

### Example 2: Startup Co-founder Conflict
```
Two co-founders:
• Founder A: 60% equity, business background
• Founder B: 40% equity, technical background

Technical decision needed:
• Founder A overrules B (has more equity)
• Wrong technical choice made
• Product fails

Problem: Power (equity) ≠ Competence (technical)
```

---

### Example 3: Equal Power Success (Google)
```
Larry Page & Sergey Brin:
• Equal ownership (50/50)
• Complementary skills
• Mutual respect
• Shared decision-making

Result: Balanced power, great outcomes
```

## 🛡️ Solutions & Best Practices

### 1. Expertise-Based Decision Rights

**Principle:**
```
Decision Authority = Relevant Expertise
NOT just equity ownership
```

**Implementation:**
```
Technical decisions → CTO decides
Marketing decisions → CMO decides
Strategy decisions → Joint decision
Financial decisions → CFO input critical
```

---

### 2. Formal Decision Processes

**Create Clear Rules:**
```
Decision Type → Decision Maker
• Routine ops → Respective leader
• Strategy → Full team vote
• Hiring → Relevant manager + approval
• Major pivots → Unanimous or 2/3
```

---

### 3. Psychological Safety

**Build Culture Where:**
✓ Everyone can speak up
✓ Ideas judged on merit
✓ Disagreement is safe
✓ Expertise is respected

**Practices:**
- Round-robin speaking
- Anonymous feedback
- Devil's advocate role
- "Yes, and..." not "No, but..."

---

### 4. Regular Power Audits

**Questions to Ask:**
```
1. Who actually makes decisions?
2. Whose ideas get implemented?
3. Who gets interrupted vs. heard?
4. Is power aligned with expertise?
5. Do all members feel valued?
```

---

### 5. Equity + Authority Alignment

**Better Structure:**
```
Equity: Based on contribution + risk
Authority: Based on expertise + role
    ↓
Clear separation:
• Equity = Financial ownership
• Authority = Decision-making
```

---

## 📈 Power Evolution Over Time

```
STAGE 1: Founding
• Founders have equal-ish power
• Informal decisions
• High trust

STAGE 2: Early Growth
• Roles formalize
• Power crystallizes
• Potential issues emerge

STAGE 3: Scale
• Need clear structure
• Power = Role + Expertise
• Formal processes critical
```

---

## ⚖️ Healthy vs. Unhealthy Power

### Healthy Power Distribution
```
✓ Based on expertise
✓ Transparent processes
✓ All voices heard
✓ Decisions explained
✓ Fairness perceived
✓ Conflict = cognitive only
```

### Unhealthy Power Distribution
```
✗ Based only on equity
✗ Arbitrary decisions
✗ Some voices ignored
✗ No explanation given
✗ Unfairness felt
✗ Affective conflicts
```

---

## 🎯 Memory Aids

### Three Problems: "ODU"
- **O**verdominance
- **D**ismatch (power ≠ competence)
- **U**nfairness (perceived)

### Remember: "All of the Above"
This is a classic "all of the above" exam question!

All three problems are REAL consequences of power imbalance.

## ✅ Self-Check

1. What problems come from power imbalance? → All: overdominance, mismatch, unfairness
2. Should power = equity? → Not always! Should also = expertise
3. What is overdominance? → Powerful members silence others
4. What is power-competence mismatch? → Wrong person decides
5. What causes perceived unfairness? → Unequal voice despite equal effort
