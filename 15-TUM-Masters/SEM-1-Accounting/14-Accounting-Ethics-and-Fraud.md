## 🎭 Common Manipulation Techniques

### 1. Revenue Recognition Fraud

**Technique**: Record revenue before earned

**Examples**:
- ❌ Recording sales before goods shipped
- ❌ "Channel stuffing" - forcing distributors to buy
- ❌ Recording fake sales
- ❌ Early recognition of long-term contracts

**Red Flags**:
- Revenue growing faster than industry
- Accounts receivable growing faster than sales
- Large sales at quarter-end

### 2. Expense Manipulation

**Technique**: Delay or hide expenses

**Examples**:
- ❌ Capitalizing expenses as assets (should be expensed immediately)
- ❌ Failing to record impairments (your discovery!)
- ❌ Underestimating warranty costs
- ❌ Hiding repairs as "improvements"

**Your Insight**: The €200 repair scenario!
```
Honest: Impair €240 + Expense €200 = Total €440 hit
Fraud: Only expense €200 = Hidden €240 loss
```

### 3. Asset Overvaluation

**Technique**: Keep assets at inflated values

**Examples**:
- ❌ No depreciation (should be systematic)
- ❌ Avoiding impairment losses
- ❌ Inflating inventory values
- ❌ Fictitious assets (Wirecard!)

### 4. Liability Understatement

**Technique**: Hide or minimize obligations

**Examples**:
- ❌ Off-balance-sheet financing
- ❌ Underestimating pension obligations
- ❌ Not recording contingent liabilities
- ❌ Hiding debt in subsidiaries

## 📊 Case Study: The Impairment Decision

### Recall Your Discovery

**Situation**: Machine breaks, costs €200 to repair, but only restores 50% capability.

**Management's Preference**:
```
Balance Sheet: Keep asset at €540
Income Statement: Expense only €200 repair
Total equity impact: -€200
Looks like: Normal operations
```

**Honest Accounting**:
```
Balance Sheet: Impair asset to €300
Income Statement: Impairment loss €240 + Repair €200
Total equity impact: -€440
Looks like: Major problem (which it is!)
```

### The Ethical Analysis

**Arguments Management Might Make** (Rationalizations):
- 🚫 "It still works, so no impairment needed"
- 🚫 "We'll make up the loss next quarter"
- 🚫 "The auditors might not catch it"
- 🚫 "Our jobs depend on good results"
- 🚫 "Everyone bends the rules a little"

**Ethical Response**:
- ✅ Accounting standards REQUIRE impairment when recoverable amount < carrying value
- ✅ Stakeholders deserve accurate information
- ✅ Two wrongs don't make a right
- ✅ Short-term pain beats long-term disaster
- ✅ Professional duty over personal interest
