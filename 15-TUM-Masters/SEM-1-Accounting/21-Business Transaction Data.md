# Unit 18 — Business Transaction Data (Overview)

## Purpose of Unit 18
Unit 18 explains **how business transactions are classified** depending on the perspective used:
- Liquidity (cash)
- Financial position (claims)
- Performance (profit & loss)
- Cost accounting (consumption)

The same transaction can affect **multiple categories at the same time**.

---

## Core Question of Unit 18
> What exactly changes when a transaction occurs?

Not:
- Is the transaction good or bad?
- Is money involved in total?

But:
- **Did cash move?**
- **Did a claim arise?**
- **Was value consumed or created?**

---

## Four Perspectives (EXAM CRITICAL)

| Perspective | Category | Measures |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Liquidity | Cash inflow / outflow | Cash movement |
| Financial | Receipt / Expenditure | Monetary claims |
| Performance | Income / Expense | Period result |
| Cost Accounting | Costs | Operational consumption |

---

## Golden Exam Rule
One transaction can trigger **none, one, two, or all three**:
- Cash effect
- Claim effect
- P&L effect


# Unit 18 — Core Definitions (Must Memorize)

---

## Cash Inflow / Cash Outflow
- Actual movement of money
- Bank account or cash register changes

Examples:
- Paying rent → Cash outflow
- Customer payment → Cash inflow

❌ Not related to profit directly

---

## Receipt (Einzahlung)
- Monetary claim **arises or is fulfilled**
- Cash may or may not move

Examples:
- Sale on credit → Receipt
- Cash sale → Receipt + Cash inflow

---

## Expenditure (Auszahlungspflicht)
- Monetary obligation arises
- Independent of cash payment

Examples:
- Buying goods on credit → Expenditure
- Paying old invoice → ❌ No expenditure

---

## Income
- Increase in net assets
- Related to value creation

Examples:
- Sale revenue
- Increase in asset value

---

## Expense
- Decrease in net assets
- Related to value consumption

Examples:
- Depreciation
- Wages
- Provisions

---

## Costs (Cost Accounting)
- Monetarily assessed **consumption**
- Only production-related
- Used internally

Exam note:
Costs ≠ Expenses (but often overlap)



# Unit 18 — Timing Logic (VERY TESTABLE)

---

## The Timing Problem
Transactions often occur in **three different moments**:
1. Obligation arises
2. Cash is paid
3. Value is consumed

These moments do NOT need to coincide.

---

## Typical Timing Scenarios

### Credit Purchase, Consumption Later
- Expenditure: now
- Expense: later
- Cash: later

---

### Cash Purchase, Immediate Consumption
- Cash outflow
- Expenditure
- Expense

(All three at once)

---

### Paying an Old Invoice
- Cash outflow
- ❌ No expenditure
- ❌ No expense

---

### Depreciation
- Expense only
- ❌ No cash
- ❌ No expenditure

---

## Exam Trick
If the question says:
- “already delivered earlier” → no expenditure
- “will be delivered later” → no expense yet


# Unit 18 — Common Transactions (Auto-Recognition)

---

## Purchase of Goods (Credit)
- Expenditure
- ❌ No cash
- ❌ No expense (until consumption)

---

## Purchase of Goods (Cash)
- Cash outflow
- Expenditure
- Expense (if consumed immediately)

---

## Sale of Goods (Credit)
- Receipt
- ❌ No cash inflow

---

## Sale of Goods (Cash)
- Cash inflow
- Receipt
- Income

---

## Depreciation
- Expense only

---

## Provision (Warranty, Risk)
- Expense only

---

## Loan Taken
- Cash inflow
- ❌ No income

---

## Loan Repayment
- Cash outflow
- ❌ No expense

---

## Asset Sale at Book Value
- Receipt
- ❌ No income


# Unit 18 — MCQ Traps & False Intuitions

---

## Trap 1: Cash = Profit ❌
Cash movements do NOT determine profit.

---

## Trap 2: Asset Purchase = Expense ❌
Assets are capitalized, not expensed.

---

## Trap 3: Loan = Income ❌
Loans increase liabilities, not income.

---

## Trap 4: Depreciation = Cash ❌
Depreciation is purely accounting.

---

## Trap 5: Credit Sale = Cash ❌
Receipt ≠ cash inflow.

---

## Safe MCQ Strategy
Watch for:
- Words like “only”, “always”, “necessarily”
→ usually false


# Unit 18 — Decision Flow (10-Second Method)

---

## Step 1 — Did cash move?
YES → Cash inflow / outflow  
NO → Nothing here

---

## Step 2 — Did a claim arise?
YES → Receipt / Expenditure  
NO → Nothing here

---

## Step 3 — Was value consumed or created?
YES → Expense / Income  
NO → Nothing here

---

## Golden Exam Sentence
> Ask these three questions in this order — every MCQ collapses.


# Unit 18 — Final Exam Checklist

Before answering ANY question, ask:

☐ Did cash move?  
☐ Did a claim arise or disappear?  
☐ Was value consumed or created in THIS period?

If you answer these:
→ correct MCQ 95% of the time
