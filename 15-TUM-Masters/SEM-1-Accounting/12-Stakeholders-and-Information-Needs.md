## 💼 Individual Stakeholder Analysis

### 1. Shareholders (Equity Providers) 📈

**What they provide**:
- Permanent capital (equity)
- Bear residual risk
- No guaranteed return

**What they want to know**:
✅ Is the company **profitable**?  
✅ Is the company **growing**?  
✅ What's my **return on investment** (ROI)?  
✅ Is my investment **safe** long-term?  
✅ Should I **hold, buy more, or sell**?

**Key Information Sources**:

| Financial Statement | What They Look For |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Income Statement** | Revenue growth, profit margins, earnings per share |
| **Balance Sheet** | Total equity, debt levels, asset base |
| **Cash Flow Statement** | Ability to generate cash, dividend capacity |

**Key Metrics**:
- **Return on Equity (ROE)** = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** = Net Income / Number of Shares
- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** = Stock Price / EPS

**Example from our case**:
- Anna's ROE = €400 / €2,400 = **16.7%**
- Ben's ROE = €400 / €900 = **44.4%**

Ben's investors see higher returns, but also higher risk!

---

### 2. Creditors/Banks (Debt Providers) 🏦

**What they provide**:
- Loans and credit
- Temporary capital
- Fixed return (interest)

**What they want to know**:
✅ Can the company **repay the debt**?  
✅ What **assets** can be seized if things go wrong?  
✅ Is cash flow **sufficient** to cover interest?  
✅ What's the **debt-to-equity ratio**?  
✅ Is the company becoming **more or less risky**?

**Key Information Sources**:

| Financial Statement | What They Look For |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Balance Sheet** | Current assets vs liabilities, collateral value |
| **Cash Flow Statement** | Operating cash flow, ability to service debt |
| **Income Statement** | Stability of earnings, interest coverage |

**Key Metrics**:
- **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** = Total Debt / Total Equity
- **Interest Coverage** = EBIT / Interest Expense

**Example from our case**:
- Anna's Debt-to-Equity = €0 / €2,400 = **0%** (very safe!)
- Ben's Debt-to-Equity = €1,000 / €900 = **111%** (higher risk)

Banks would charge Ben higher interest rates due to higher risk.

### 3. Government/Tax Authorities 🏛️

**What they want**:
- Tax revenue
- Compliance with regulations
- Accurate reporting

**What they want to know**:
✅ What is **taxable income**?  
✅ Are **sales taxes** calculated correctly?  
✅ Are **payroll taxes** properly withheld?  
✅ Is the company **complying with laws**?

**Key Focus**:
- **Income Statement** → Calculate tax on profits
- **Balance Sheet** → Verify asset valuations for tax purposes
- **Payroll Records** → Employee tax withholdings

**Tax Calculation**:
```
Accounting Profit                €400
+/- Tax Adjustments             (varies)
= Taxable Income                 €XXX
× Tax Rate (e.g., 25%)          ×0.25
= Tax Payable                    €XXX
```

## 🎭 Conflicting Interests

### The Tension Between Stakeholders

```mermaid

    A[Company Profit: €100] --> B{How to use it?}
    
    B --> C[Pay Dividends<br/>to Shareholders]
    B --> D[Pay Down Debt<br/>to Creditors]
    B --> E[Invest in Growth<br/>for Future]
    B --> F[Increase Wages<br/>for Employees]
    B --> G[Lower Prices<br/>for Customers]
    
    C -.Conflicts with.-> D
    C -.Conflicts with.-> E
    E -.Conflicts with.-> C
    F -.Conflicts with.-> C
    
    style B fill:#ffe1e1
```

### Real-World Examples of Conflicts:

**1. Dividends vs. Debt Repayment**
- Shareholders want: High dividends
- Creditors want: Debt paid down first
- Cannot maximize both!

**2. Short-term Profit vs. Long-term Investment**
- Current shareholders: Maximize today's profit
- Future stakeholders: Invest in R&D, equipment
- Management must balance!

**3. Wages vs. Profit**
- Employees want: Higher salaries
- Shareholders want: Higher profits
- Direct trade-off!

## 🌍 Beyond Financial Stakeholders

### The Broader View: ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)

Modern stakeholder theory recognizes **non-financial** impacts:

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Stakeholder Value))
    Financial Capital
      Profits
      Returns
      Growth
    Manufactured Capital
      Equipment
      Infrastructure
      Technology
    Human Capital
      Employees
      Skills
      Culture
    Intellectual Capital
      Patents
      Knowledge
      Innovation
    Natural Capital
      Environment
      Resources
      Sustainability
    Social Capital
      Relationships
      Reputation
      Trust
```

**Modern Reporting Includes**:
- Carbon footprint
- Employee diversity
- Community investment
- Ethical practices
- Sustainability goals

**Example from course**: McDonald's green logo - signals environmental commitment to broader stakeholder base.

## ⚖️ The Stewardship Function

### Management as Steward

    A[Stakeholders] --> B[Provide Resources]
    B --> C[Management<br/>Controls Resources]
    C --> D[Business Activities]
    D --> E[Generate Returns]
    E --> F[Accounting Reports<br/>Performance]
    F --> G[Stakeholders Evaluate]
    G --> H{Satisfied?}
    
    H -->|Yes| I[Continue/Increase<br/>Investment]
    H -->|No| J[Withdraw/Reduce<br/>Investment]
    
    I --> B
    J --> K[Company Struggles]
    
    style F fill:#e1f5ff
    style C fill:#ffe1e1
```

**Stewardship = Accountability**

Management must report:
- How resources were used
- What results were achieved
- Whether stakeholder interests were served

**When stewardship fails**: Wirecard, Bayer/Monsanto (from course materials)
