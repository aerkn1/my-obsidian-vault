## 👨‍🔬 Detailed Researcher Profiles

---

## 1. Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782)

### **Background**
Swiss mathematician and physicist from famous Bernoulli family of scholars.

### **Major Contribution: Expected Utility Theory**

**The St. Petersburg Paradox (1738):**
```
Coin flip game:
- Heads: You win €2
- If tails, flip again
  - Heads: Win €4
  - If tails, flip again
    - Heads: Win €8
    - And so on...

Expected Value: INFINITE!
(1/2 × €2 + 1/4 × €4 + 1/8 × €8 + ...)

Question: How much would you pay to play?

Most people: Only €5-10!
Why not pay €1,000 if expected value is infinite?
```

**Bernoulli's Solution: UTILITY, not monetary value**

```
People maximize Expected UTILITY, not Expected Value

Utility = Satisfaction/Happiness from money

Key insight:
€100 to poor person: High utility
€100 to billionaire: Minimal utility

Diminishing marginal utility of wealth!
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
U(W) = log(W)  [Bernoulli's utility function]

Where:
U = Utility
W = Wealth

This explains:
- Risk aversion
- Insurance demand
- Portfolio diversification
- Why people don't bet everything
```

### **Legacy**
- Foundation of **decision theory**
- Basis for **modern finance** (risk-return tradeoff)
- **Insurance** industry principles
- **Risk management** theory

---

## 2. Ludwig Erhard (1897-1977)

### **Background**
German economist and politician, Chancellor of West Germany (1963-1966).

### **Major Contribution: Social Market Economy (Soziale Marktwirtschaft)**

**The Post-WWII German Economic Miracle:**

```
1948: Germany in ruins after WWII
      Currency reform (Deutsche Mark introduced)
      Erhard implements "Social Market Economy"

1950s-1960s: "Wirtschaftswunder" (Economic Miracle)
             Average GDP growth: 8% per year
             Full employment
             Rising living standards
```

**Core Philosophy:**
```
Social Market Economy = Free Market + Social Safety Net

Market Component:
✅ Competition
✅ Private property
✅ Price mechanism
✅ Entrepreneurship
✅ Limited government intervention

+

Social Component:
✅ Progressive taxation
✅ Universal healthcare
✅ Pension system
✅ Worker protection
✅ Codetermination (workers on boards)
```

**Famous Quote:**
> "Prosperity for all" (Wohlstand für Alle)

**Balance:**
```
Not pure capitalism (like US)
Not socialism (like East Germany)

Middle path:
- Efficiency of markets
- Social responsibility
- Prevents both extremes
```

### **Key Policies**
1. **Currency reform** (1948) - Stable money
2. **Price liberalization** - Let markets work
3. **Anti-cartel laws** - Ensure competition
4. **Social insurance** - Safety net
5. **Tax reform** - Incentives to work

### **Legacy**
- **German economic model** (still used today)
- Influenced **European social democracy**
- Model for **Austria, Netherlands, Nordics**
- Balance between efficiency and equity

## 3. Robert Edward Freeman (1951-)

### **Background**
American philosopher and management professor, University of Virginia.

### **Major Contribution: Stakeholder Theory (1984)**

**Revolutionary Book:**
"Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach"

**Core Idea:**
```
Traditional View (Friedman):
Company exists to maximize SHAREHOLDER value
Shareholders are only important group

Freeman's View:
Company must balance ALL STAKEHOLDER interests
Multiple groups have legitimate claims
```

**Stakeholder Definition:**
> "Any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives"

**Stakeholder Map:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[THE COMPANY] --> B[Shareholders]
    A --> C[Employees]
    A --> D[Customers]
    A --> E[Suppliers]
    A --> F[Community]
    A --> G[Government]
    A --> H[Environment]
    A --> I[Creditors]
    
    style A fill:#d4edda
```

**Key Principles:**

**1. Stakeholder Interdependence:**
```
Success requires satisfying multiple groups:

Employees: Fair wages, good conditions
Customers: Quality products, fair prices
Suppliers: Fair contracts, timely payment
Community: Jobs, taxes, environmental care
Shareholders: Returns on investment

Can't maximize one at expense of others!
```

**2. Stakeholder Management:**
```
Identify stakeholders
→ Understand their interests
→ Prioritize claims
→ Balance competing demands
→ Create shared value
```

**3. Long-term Value Creation:**
```
Short-term shareholder focus → Destroys value

Example:
Cut wages → Unhappy employees → Lower productivity
Pollute → Community backlash → Regulation
Cheat customers → Lost reputation → Sales decline

Stakeholder approach → Sustainable value
```

### **Contrasts with Friedman**

| Aspect | Friedman | Freeman |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Primary Goal** | Shareholder profit | Stakeholder balance |
| **Time Horizon** | Often short-term | Long-term sustainable |
| **Social Responsibility** | No (beyond law) | Yes (moral duty) |
| **Decision Criterion** | Maximize profit | Balance interests |
| **View of Business** | Profit machine | Social institution |

### **Legacy**
- Foundation of **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**
- Basis for **ESG investing** (Environmental, Social, Governance)
- **B Corporations** (Benefit corporations)
- Modern **stakeholder capitalism**
- **UN Sustainable Development Goals** alignment

---

## 4. Friedrich von Hayek (1899-1992)

### **Background**
Austrian-British economist, Nobel Prize 1974, major figure in Austrian School of Economics.

### **Major Contributions**

**1. The Knowledge Problem**

```
Central Planning Problem:

No single person/committee can know:
- Everyone's preferences
- All resources available
- Best uses of resources
- Local conditions everywhere

Knowledge is DISPERSED across millions of people

Example:
Baker in Munich knows:
- Local customer preferences
- Quality of flour suppliers
- When to bake bread

Central planner in Berlin knows NONE of this!

Conclusion: Central planning cannot work efficiently
```

**2. Price Signals as Information**

```
Prices coordinate dispersed knowledge WITHOUT central planner!

Example: Copper shortage

Copper mine floods
→ Copper scarce
→ Price ↑
→ Manufacturers use less copper
→ Consumers buy fewer copper products
→ Inventors seek copper substitutes

NO central planner needed!
Price signal coordinates millions of decisions
```

**Famous Quote:**
> "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design."

**3. Spontaneous Order**

```
Complex, beneficial systems emerge WITHOUT design:

Examples:
- Language (no one designed English)
- Common law (evolved over centuries)
- Markets (no central coordinator)
- Cities (organic growth)
- Internet (decentralized)

Order doesn't require a designer!
```

**4. The Road to Serfdom (1944)**

```
Argument:
Government economic planning → Loss of freedom

Steps:
1. Government takes economic control
2. Must force compliance with plan
3. Individual choice eliminated
4. Political freedom follows economic freedom
5. End result: Totalitarianism

Even if planners have good intentions!
```

### **The Great Debate: Hayek vs. Keynes**

| Issue | Hayek | Keynes |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Recessions** | Let markets adjust | Government intervene |
| **Unemployment** | Temporary, self-correcting | Government create jobs |
| **Knowledge** | Dispersed, local | Can be centralized |
| **Role of State** | Minimal (referee) | Active (player) |
| **Planning** | Impossible, dangerous | Necessary, beneficial |

### **Legacy**
- Foundation of **libertarian economics**
- Critique of **socialism/central planning**
- Influenced **Reagan & Thatcher** policies
- **Free market** advocacy
- **Property rights** emphasis

---

## 5. Daniel Kahneman (1934-2024)

### **Background**
Israeli-American psychologist, Nobel Prize Economics 2002 (with Vernon Smith), pioneered behavioral economics with Amos Tversky.

### **Major Contributions**

**1. Two Systems of Thinking**

```
System 1: Fast, Automatic, Intuitive
- Unconscious
- Effortless  
- Emotional
- Quick judgments
- Pattern recognition

Example: 2 + 2 = ?
         Recognize angry face
         Understand simple sentence

System 2: Slow, Deliberate, Logical
- Conscious
- Effortful
- Rational
- Complex calculations
- Careful analysis

Example: 23 × 47 = ?
         Fill tax return
         Evaluate investment
```

**The Problem:**
```
System 1 often answers for System 2!

Result: Systematic errors (biases)

Example:
"Is Bill shy? He likes poetry and wears glasses."
System 1: "Sounds like librarian!"
System 2 should think: "Base rate? Most people aren't librarians..."

We rely on System 1 too much!
```

**2. Cognitive Biases (with Tversky)**

**Anchoring:**
```
First number influences judgment

Experiment:
Group A: "Is Gandhi older/younger than 9 when he died?"
Group B: "Is Gandhi older/younger than 140 when he died?"

Then both guess actual age:

Group A average: 50 years
Group B average: 67 years

Same question, different anchor → Different answers!

Business application:
First salary offer anchors negotiation
Initial price anchors perceived value
```

**Availability Bias:**
```
Recent/vivid events seem more likely

After airplane crash: People overestimate flight risk
After lottery winner: People overestimate winning odds
After shark attack: People fear swimming

Actual probabilities unchanged!
Recent memory makes it "available"
```

**Loss Aversion:**
```
Losses hurt ~2× more than equal gains feel good

Test:
Win €50 vs. Lose €50

Emotional impact:
Gain: +5 happiness units
Loss: -10 happiness units

Result: People very risk-averse for losses
```

**3. Prospect Theory (1979) - Nobel Prize Work**

**Key Finding: People are NOT rational about risk!**

```
GAINS: People are RISK-AVERSE

Would you rather:
A) Guaranteed €500
B) 50% chance €1,000, 50% chance €0

Most choose A (even though both = €500 expected value)

LOSSES: People are RISK-SEEKING

Would you rather:
A) Guaranteed LOSE €500  
B) 50% chance LOSE €1,000, 50% chance LOSE €0

Most choose B (gambling to avoid certain loss!)

This is IRRATIONAL! Same math, opposite behavior!
```

**Value Function:**
```
     Gains
       ↑
       |     ___-- (Concave = Risk Averse)
       |  __/
       | /
_______|_______ Reference Point
      /|
    _/ |
  _/   | (Convex = Risk Seeking)
       ↓
     Losses

Key features:
1. Reference dependent (not absolute wealth)
2. Loss aversion (steeper for losses)
3. Diminishing sensitivity (extreme outcomes matter less)
```

**4. Framing Effects**

```
Same facts, different presentation = Different choices!

Example: Medical treatment decision

Frame A: "90% survival rate"
         → 80% choose treatment

Frame B: "10% mortality rate"  
         → 50% choose treatment

SAME INFORMATION! Different frame!
```

### **Legacy**
- Founded **behavioral economics**
- Disproved **rational actor model**
- Influenced **policy design** ("Nudge" theory)
- Changed **marketing** (framing, anchoring)
- Improved **risk assessment**
- **Better decision-making** frameworks

## 6. Milton Friedman (1912-2006)

### **Background**
American economist, Nobel Prize 1976, leader of Chicago School of Economics, advisor to Reagan and Thatcher.

### **Major Contributions**

**1. Shareholder Value Primacy**

**Famous 1970 NYT Article:**
> "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits"

```
Friedman's Argument:

1. Corporations are NOT people
   They can't have social responsibilities
   Only PEOPLE have responsibilities

2. Managers are AGENTS of shareholders
   Their job: Maximize shareholder wealth
   Not: Pursue social causes with shareholders' money

3. "Social responsibility" = Spending someone else's money
   Managers who pursue CSR are:
   - Taxing shareholders (lower returns)
   - Taxing employees (lower wages)
   - Taxing customers (higher prices)

4. Let shareholders decide social causes
   Earn profit → Shareholders donate to causes THEY choose
```

**Key Quote:**
> "There is one and only one social responsibility of business: to increase its profits"

**Caveats Friedman Added:**
```
"...so long as it:
1. Stays within rules of game
2. Engages in open and free competition
3. Without deception or fraud"

NOT "profit at any cost"!
Still must follow law and ethics
```

**2. Monetarism**

**Core Theory:**
```
"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"

MV = PY

Where:
M = Money supply
V = Velocity (how fast money circulates)
P = Price level
Y = Real output

If M ↑ faster than Y → P ↑ (Inflation!)

Solution: Control money supply growth
```

**Policy Prescription:**
```
Central Bank should:
✅ Grow money supply at steady, predictable rate
✅ Match long-run GDP growth (≈ 3%)
✅ Be transparent and rule-based

Central Bank should NOT:
❌ Try to "fine-tune" economy
❌ Respond to every shock  
❌ Be discretionary and political
```

**3. Critique of Keynesianism**

**"Money matters" (vs. Keynes "fiscal policy matters"):**

```
Keynes said: Government spending controls economy
Friedman said: Money supply controls economy

Great Depression debate:
Keynes: Lack of demand → Government must spend
Friedman: Federal Reserve contracted money supply 30%!
         That caused Depression, not demand
```

**4. Free Market Advocacy**

**Policy Positions:**
- **School vouchers** (parental choice)
- **Negative income tax** (predecessor to UBI)
- **Floating exchange rates** (not fixed)
- **Volunteer military** (not draft)
- **Opposed:** Minimum wage, rent control, tariffs

**Philosophy:**
```
Free markets:
✅ Maximize individual freedom
✅ Allocate resources efficiently
✅ Self-correcting

Government intervention:
❌ Reduces freedom
❌ Creates inefficiency
❌ Has unintended consequences
```

### **Legacy**
- **Shareholder capitalism** dominance (1980-2020)
- **Monetarism** influenced central banking
- **Deregulation** movement (Reagan/Thatcher)
- **Globalization** advocacy
- Now being **questioned** (rise of stakeholder capitalism)

**Modern Debate:**
```
2019: Business Roundtable rejects Friedman
      "Purpose of corporation includes ALL stakeholders"

Critics say:
- Short-termism
- Inequality
- Environmental damage

Defenders say:
- Economic growth
- Poverty reduction
- Innovation
```

## 7. John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)

### **Background**
British economist, Cambridge professor, Treasury official, architect of post-WWII financial system.

### **Major Contribution: Keynesian Economics**

**Revolutionary Book:**
"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" (1936)

**Context:**
```
1930s Great Depression:
- 25% unemployment
- Collapsing output
- Deflation

Classical economists: "Markets will self-correct, just wait"
Keynes: "In the long run we are all dead"
```

**Core Theory: Aggregate Demand**

```
Economy's output determined by DEMAND, not supply

Y = C + I + G + (X - M)

Where:
Y = GDP (output)
C = Consumption
I = Investment
G = Government spending
X = Exports
M = Imports

If (C + I) falls → Recession
Solution: Increase G (government spending)!
```

**The Multiplier Effect:**

```
Government spends €1M on bridge:

Direct effect: €1M to construction workers

Indirect effects:
Workers spend 80% of income (€800K)
→ Businesses receive €800K
→ They spend 80% (€640K)
→ Continues...

Total effect: €1M × (1/0.2) = €5M!

Multiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC)
If MPC = 0.8 → Multiplier = 5

€1M government spending → €5M total GDP increase
```

**Paradox of Thrift:**

```
Individual level:
Saving is good! (prudent)

Aggregate level:
If EVERYONE saves → Disaster!

Why?
Everyone saves more
→ Spend less
→ Businesses sell less
→ Lay off workers
→ Unemployment ↑
→ Income ↓
→ End up POORER!

My spending = Your income
If I cut spending → You lose income

Composition fallacy:
What's good for individual ≠ good for aggregate
```

**Liquidity Trap:**

```
Sometimes: Lower interest rates DON'T stimulate!

Normal times:
Interest rate ↓ → Borrowing ↑ → Spending ↑ → Economy grows

Liquidity trap:
Interest rate already 0%
Can't go lower!
People still won't spend (fear, uncertainty)

Solution: Fiscal policy (government spending)
           Monetary policy (interest rates) doesn't work!
```

### **Policy Prescriptions**

**Recession:**
```
✅ Increase government spending
✅ Cut taxes (stimulus)
✅ Lower interest rates
✅ Run budget deficits (temporary)

Goal: Increase aggregate demand
      Restore full employment
```

**Boom:**
```
✅ Decrease government spending
✅ Raise taxes (cool off)
✅ Raise interest rates
✅ Run budget surpluses

Goal: Prevent inflation
      "Take away the punch bowl"
```

**Counter-Cyclical Policy:**
```
Deficit in recession → Surplus in boom
Balance over CYCLE, not every year
```

### **Legacy**

**Bretton Woods (1944):**
- Keynes negotiated post-WWII financial system
- Created **IMF** (International Monetary Fund)
- Created **World Bank**
- Fixed exchange rates (until 1971)

**Keynesian Economics Dominated:**
- 1940s-1970s: "Keynesian consensus"
- Governments actively managed demand
- Mixed results (growth + inflation)

**Decline:**
- 1970s "stagflation" (high inflation + unemployment)
- Monetarism/supply-side takes over (1980s)

**Revival:**
- 2008 Financial Crisis → Keynesian stimulus
- COVID-19 → Massive government spending
- "We're all Keynesians in a crisis"

### **Famous Quotes**
> "The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones."

> "Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist."

## 8. Harry Markowitz (1927-2023)

### **Background**
American economist, Nobel Prize 1990, father of modern finance.

### **Major Contribution: Modern Portfolio Theory (1952)**

**Revolutionary PhD Dissertation:**
"Portfolio Selection" - Journal of Finance (1952)

**The Problem He Solved:**

```
Before Markowitz:
Investors picked "good stocks"
Diversification was intuitive, not mathematical

Question: HOW MUCH diversification? WHICH stocks?

Markowitz: Gave MATHEMATICAL answer!
```

**Key Insight: It's Not About Individual Stocks**

```
WRONG approach:
Pick stocks with highest expected return

Markowitz approach:
Pick PORTFOLIO with best return-risk tradeoff

The COMBINATION matters!
```

**Diversification Math:**

```
Stock A: Return 10%, Risk (σ) 20%
Stock B: Return 10%, Risk (σ) 20%

Portfolio A+B (50-50):
Expected return: 10% (average)

Portfolio risk: NOT 20%!
Depends on CORRELATION (ρ)

If ρ = +1.0 (perfect correlation):
Portfolio risk = 20% (no benefit!)

If ρ = 0 (uncorrelated):
Portfolio risk = 14.1% (reduced!)

If ρ = -1.0 (perfect negative correlation):
Portfolio risk = 0%! (perfect diversification)

Formula:
σ_portfolio = √(w₁²σ₁² + w₂²σ₂² + 2w₁w₂ρσ₁σ₂)
```

**The Efficient Frontier:**

```
Risk (σ)
│
│           • (High risk, high return)
│        •••
│      •••
│    •••  ← Efficient Frontier
│  •••
│•••______________________________
0                           Return (μ)

Efficient Frontier:
- Best possible portfolios
- Maximum return for given risk
- Minimum risk for given return

Portfolios BELOW frontier: Suboptimal!
Can get better return for same risk
```

**Optimal Portfolio:**

```
Depends on investor's risk tolerance:

Conservative: Low risk, low return (left side)
Moderate: Medium risk, medium return (middle)
Aggressive: High risk, high return (right side)

But ALL on efficient frontier!
```

**Two-Fund Separation Theorem:**

```
1. Risk-free asset (government bonds)
2. Optimal risky portfolio (tangency portfolio)

Every investor should hold:
- Some combination of THESE TWO
- Nothing else needed!

Conservative: 80% bonds, 20% risky portfolio
Aggressive: 20% bonds, 80% risky portfolio
```

### **Practical Impact**

**Before Markowitz:**
```
"Don't put all eggs in one basket" (intuition)
But HOW MANY baskets? WHICH eggs in WHICH basket?
```

**After Markowitz:**
```
✅ Mathematical answer to diversification
✅ Can calculate optimal portfolios
✅ Quantify risk precisely
✅ Risk-return tradeoffs explicit
```

### **Legacy**

**Investment Management:**
- **Mutual funds** (instant diversification)
- **Index funds** (efficient frontier)
- **Asset allocation** (stocks, bonds, real estate)
- **Robo-advisors** (automated Markowitz)

**Risk Management:**
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**
- **Portfolio optimization software**
- **Risk budgeting**

**Modern Finance:**
- Foundation for **CAPM** (Capital Asset Pricing Model)
- Basis for **Black-Scholes** options pricing
- **Sharpe Ratio** (return per unit risk)

**Real World Application:**
```
You invest €10,000:

Bad approach:
€10,000 in one stock → Very risky!

Good approach (Markowitz):
€2,000 in 5 stocks (low correlation)
Risk reduced by ~50%!

Better approach:
Index fund: 500+ stocks
Risk reduced by ~70%!

"Diversification is the only free lunch in finance"
```
