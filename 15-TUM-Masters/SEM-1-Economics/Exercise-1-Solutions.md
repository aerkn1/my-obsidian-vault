## Problem 1: Two Pirates (Jack and Will)

### Given Information
- **Jack:** 40 hours/week, produces 1 kg fish/hour OR 0.25 kg rum/hour
- **Will:** 40 hours/week, produces 0.2 kg fish/hour OR 0.2 kg rum/hour
- **Goal:** Each wants 5 kg rum/week + maximum fish possible

---

### Part (a): Absolute and Comparative Advantages

#### Step 1: Absolute Advantage (Direct Comparison)

**Fish:**
- Jack: 1 kg/hour
- Will: 0.2 kg/hour
- **Jack has absolute advantage** (produces more per hour)

**Rum:**
- Jack: 0.25 kg/hour
- Will: 0.2 kg/hour
- **Jack has absolute advantage** (produces more per hour)

**Conclusion:** Jack has absolute advantage in BOTH goods.

---

#### Step 2: Calculate Opportunity Costs

**For Jack:**
- Produces 1 kg fish OR 0.25 kg rum per hour
- OC of 1 kg fish = 0.25 kg rum (what he gives up)
- OC of 1 kg rum = 1/0.25 = 4 kg fish

**For Will:**
- Produces 0.2 kg fish OR 0.2 kg rum per hour
- OC of 0.2 kg fish = 0.2 kg rum
- OC of 1 kg fish = 1 kg rum
- OC of 1 kg rum = 1 kg fish

**Summary Table:**

| Producer | OC of Fish | OC of Rum |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Jack | 0.25 rum | 4 fish |
| Will | 1 rum | 1 fish |

---

#### Step 3: Comparative Advantage (Compare OCs)

**Fish:**
- Jack's OC = 0.25 rum < Will's OC = 1 rum
- **Jack has comparative advantage in fish** ✓

**Rum:**
- Jack's OC = 4 fish > Will's OC = 1 fish
- **Will has comparative advantage in rum** ✓

---

**Answer:**
- **Absolute advantage:** Jack in both fish and rum
- **Comparative advantage:** Jack in fish, Will in rum

---

### Part (b): Transformation Curves

#### Individual Production Possibilities

**Jack (40 hours):**
- Max fish: 40 hrs × 1 kg/hr = 40 kg fish
- Max rum: 40 hrs × 0.25 kg/hr = 10 kg rum
- Transformation curve: Line from (40, 0) to (0, 10)
- Slope: -10/40 = -0.25 (opportunity cost of fish)

**Will (40 hours):**
- Max fish: 40 hrs × 0.2 kg/hr = 8 kg fish
- Max rum: 40 hrs × 0.2 kg/hr = 8 kg rum
- Transformation curve: Line from (8, 0) to (0, 8)
- Slope: -8/8 = -1 (opportunity cost of fish)

---

#### Joint Transformation Curve

**Strategy:** Order producers by OC of horizontal axis good (fish):
- Jack: OC of fish = 0.25 rum (lowest)
- Will: OC of fish = 1 rum (higher)

**Construction (starting from max rum):**

**Point 1: Maximum rum (0 fish)**
- Both produce only rum
- Jack: 10 kg rum
- Will: 8 kg rum
- **Coordinates: (0, 18)**

**Point 2: Jack switches to fish**
- Jack produces all fish: 40 kg
- Will still produces rum: 8 kg
- **Coordinates: (40, 8)**

**Point 3: Will also switches to fish**
- Jack: 40 kg fish
- Will: 8 kg fish
- **Coordinates: (48, 0)**

**Joint curve vertices:** (0, 18) → (40, 8) → (48, 0)

**Key insight:** Joint curve is kinked, with slopes:
- Segment 1: Slope = -18/40 = -0.45 (Jack's OC)
- Segment 2: Slope = -8/8 = -1 (Will's OC)

---

### Part (c): Gains from Trade (Terms: 1 rum = 3 fish)

#### Autarky (No Trade)

**Jack:**
- Needs 5 kg rum: 5/0.25 = 20 hours
- Remaining for fish: 40 - 20 = 20 hours
- Fish production: 20 × 1 = **20 kg fish**

**Will:**
- Needs 5 kg rum: 5/0.2 = 25 hours
- Remaining for fish: 40 - 25 = 15 hours
- Fish production: 15 × 0.2 = **3 kg fish**

**Total autarky fish:** 20 + 3 = 23 kg

---

#### With Trade (Terms: 1 rum for 3 fish)

**Feasibility check:**
- Jack's OC of rum = 4 fish
- Will's OC of rum = 1 fish
- Trade rate = 3 fish per rum
- **1 < 3 < 4** ✓ Feasible!

**Strategy:** Specialize based on comparative advantage
- Will specializes in rum (his comparative advantage)
- Jack specializes in fish (his comparative advantage)

**Will's production:**
- 40 hours × 0.2 kg/hr = 8 kg rum total
- Keeps 5 kg for himself
- Trades 3 kg rum to Jack

**Jack's production:**
- Receives 3 kg rum from trade
- Needs: 5 - 3 = 2 kg more rum
- Time for 2 kg rum: 2/0.25 = 8 hours
- Remaining for fish: 40 - 8 = 32 hours
- Fish produced: 32 kg
- Pays for trade: 3 kg rum × 3 fish/rum = 9 kg fish
- Net fish: 32 - 9 = **23 kg fish**

**Will's consumption:**
- Receives from trade: 9 kg fish
- Net fish: **9 kg fish**

---

#### Gains from Trade

**Jack:**
- Autarky: 20 kg fish
- With trade: 23 kg fish
- **Gain: +3 kg fish** ✓

**Will:**
- Autarky: 3 kg fish
- With trade: 9 kg fish
- **Gain: +6 kg fish** ✓

**Total:** Both benefit! Jack gains 3 kg, Will gains 6 kg.

---

### Part (d): Joint Transformation Curve with Liz

#### New Information

**Liz:** 30 hours/week, produces 0.2 kg fish/hour OR 0.5 kg rum/hour

**Liz's opportunity costs:**
- OC of fish: 0.5/0.2 = 2.5 kg rum
- OC of rum: 0.2/0.5 = 0.4 kg fish

**Updated OC ranking:**

| Producer | OC of Fish | OC of Rum |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Jack | 0.25 rum | 4 fish |
| Will | 1 rum | 1 fish |
| Liz | 2.5 rum | 0.4 fish |

**Comparative advantages:**
- **Rum:** Liz (0.4) < Will (1) < Jack (4) → Liz best at rum
- **Fish:** Jack (0.25) < Will (1) < Liz (2.5) → Jack best at fish

---

#### Maximum Production Capabilities

- **Jack:** 40 kg fish OR 10 kg rum
- **Will:** 8 kg fish OR 8 kg rum
- **Liz:** 6 kg fish (30 × 0.2) OR 15 kg rum (30 × 0.5)

---

#### Joint Transformation Curve Construction

**Point 1: Maximum rum (0 fish)**
- All produce rum: 10 + 8 + 15 = 33 kg rum
- **Coordinates: (0, 33)**

**Point 2: Jack switches to fish**
- Jack: 40 kg fish, 0 rum
- Will: 0 fish, 8 rum
- Liz: 0 fish, 15 rum
- **Coordinates: (40, 23)**

**Point 3: Will switches to fish**
- Jack: 40 kg fish
- Will: 8 kg fish, 0 rum
- Liz: 0 fish, 15 rum
- **Coordinates: (48, 15)**

**Point 4: Liz switches to fish**
- Jack: 40 kg fish
- Will: 8 kg fish
- Liz: 6 kg fish, 0 rum
- **Coordinates: (54, 0)**

**Joint curve vertices:** (0, 33) → (40, 23) → (48, 15) → (54, 0)

---

### Part (e): Gains from Trade (Terms: 1 rum = 0.8 fish)

#### Autarky

**Jack:** 20 kg fish (from before)
**Will:** 3 kg fish (from before)
**Liz:**
- Needs 5 kg rum: 5/0.5 = 10 hours
- Remaining: 30 - 10 = 20 hours
- Fish: 20 × 0.2 = **4 kg fish**

**Total autarky fish:** 20 + 3 + 4 = 27 kg

---

#### With Trade (Terms: 1 rum for 0.8 fish)

**Feasibility check:**
- Best rum producer (Liz): OC = 0.4 fish
- Worst rum producer (Jack): OC = 4 fish
- Trade rate = 0.8 fish per rum
- **0.4 < 0.8 < 4** ✓ Feasible!

**Strategy:**
- Liz specializes in rum (comparative advantage)
- Jack and Will produce fish

**Liz's production:**
- 30 hours × 0.5 kg/hr = 15 kg rum
- Keeps 5 kg
- Available to trade: 10 kg rum

**Trade distribution:**
- 10 kg rum can buy: 10 × 0.8 = 8 kg fish (Liz receives this)
- Jack and Will need to provide: 8 kg fish + their own 10 kg rum

**Will's strategy:**
- Will produces his own 5 kg rum: 25 hours
- Remaining: 15 hours for fish → 3 kg fish
- Will doesn't trade (not beneficial at these terms)

**Jack's strategy:**
- Needs 5 kg rum from trade
- Must pay: 5 kg rum / 0.8 fish per rum = 6.25 kg fish
- Jack produces all fish: 40 kg
- Net: 40 - 6.25 = **33.75 kg fish**

**Alternative allocation** (more efficient):
Let's reconsider with Jack producing some rum:

**Jack:** Produces 2 kg rum (8 hrs) + 32 kg fish (32 hrs)
- Trades 9 kg fish for 3 kg rum from Liz
- Total rum: 2 + 3 = 5 kg ✓
- Net fish: 32 - 9 = **23 kg**

**Will:** Produces 5 kg rum (25 hrs) + 3 kg fish (15 hrs)
- Receives nothing, pays nothing
- Net fish: **3 kg**

**Liz:** Produces 15 kg rum
- Keeps 5 kg, trades 10 kg
- Receives: 10 × 0.8 = **8 kg fish**

Wait, this doesn't work either. Let me recalculate properly:

If 1 rum trades for 0.8 fish, that means 1 fish trades for 1.25 rum.

**Optimal allocation:**
- **Liz:** Full rum (15 kg), keeps 5, trades 10
- **Jack:** Gets 5 kg rum by paying 5/0.8 = 6.25 kg fish
- **Will:** Gets 5 kg rum by paying 5/0.8 = 6.25 kg fish

Jack produces: 40 kg fish, pays 6.25, keeps **33.75 kg**
Will needs to produce: 6.25 kg fish + his consumption

But Will can only produce 8 kg fish total, so:
Will produces 8 kg fish, pays 6.25, keeps **1.75 kg fish**

**Gains from trade:**
- Jack: 33.75 - 20 = **+13.75 kg**
- Will: 1.75 - 3 = **-1.25 kg** (worse off!)
- Liz: 8 - 4 = **+4 kg**

**Note:** Will is worse off with these terms! This shows that not all trades benefit everyone equally. The terms of trade matter significantly.

## Problems 2-6: Carl and Gottlieb

### Problem 2: Absolute and Comparative Advantage

**Given:**
- Carl: 16 days per car body, 4 days per engine (300 days/year)
- Gottlieb: 10 days per car body, 5 days per engine (300 days/year)

**Step 1: Absolute Advantage**
- Car bodies: Carl needs 16 days, Gottlieb needs 10 days → **Gottlieb faster** ✓
- Engines: Carl needs 4 days, Gottlieb needs 5 days → **Carl faster** ✓

**Step 2: Opportunity Costs**

**Carl:**
- 1 car body takes 16 days = time for 16/4 = 4 engines
- **OC of 1 body = 4 engines**
- **OC of 1 engine = 1/4 body = 0.25 bodies**

**Gottlieb:**
- 1 car body takes 10 days = time for 10/5 = 2 engines
- **OC of 1 body = 2 engines**
- **OC of 1 engine = 1/2 body = 0.5 bodies**

**Step 3: Comparative Advantage**
- Bodies: Gottlieb (OC = 2 engines) < Carl (OC = 4 engines) → **Gottlieb** ✓
- Engines: Carl (OC = 0.25 bodies) < Gottlieb (OC = 0.5 bodies) → **Carl** ✓

**Answer: (B)** Gottlieb has both absolute and comparative advantage in car bodies.

---

### Problem 3: Maximum Vehicles Under Autarky

**Key:** Each vehicle needs 1 body + 1 engine.

**Carl:**
- Time per vehicle: 16 + 4 = 20 days
- Maximum vehicles: 300/20 = **15 vehicles**

**Gottlieb:**
- Time per vehicle: 10 + 5 = 15 days
- Maximum vehicles: 300/15 = **20 vehicles**

**Answer: (C)** Carl 15 and Gottlieb 20 vehicles

---

### Problem 4: Maximum Joint Production

**Strategy:** Use comparative advantages
- Carl → engines (comparative advantage)
- Gottlieb → bodies (comparative advantage)

**If fully specialized:**
- Carl: 300/4 = 75 engines
- Gottlieb: 300/10 = 30 bodies
- Vehicles: min(75, 30) = 30 (limited by bodies)

But Carl makes 75 engines, only 30 used. Can we do better?

**Optimal allocation:** Gottlieb makes all bodies, Carl balances.

Let Carl make $x$ bodies and $y$ engines:
- $16x + 4y = 300$ (Carl's time)
- $x + 30 = y$ (match bodies and engines)

Substitute: $16x + 4(x + 30) = 300$
- $16x + 4x + 120 = 300$
- $20x = 180$
- $x = 9$ bodies

Carl: 9 bodies, 39 engines
Gottlieb: 30 bodies, 0 engines
Total vehicles: 30 + 9 = **39 vehicles** ✓

**Answer: (B)** 39 vehicles

---

### Problem 5: Feasible Terms of Trade

**Opportunity costs:**
- Carl: 1 body = 4 engines, 1 engine = 0.25 bodies
- Gottlieb: 1 body = 2 engines, 1 engine = 0.5 bodies

**For engines per body:**
- Must be between 2 and 4 engines per body

**For bodies per engine:**
- Must be between 0.25 and 0.5 bodies per engine
- Or: between 1/4 and 1/2 bodies per engine

Looking at options:
(A) between 1/4 and 1/2 car bodies per engine ✓

But the question asks about "terms of trade" which could be stated either way.

(D) says: between 2 and 4 car bodies per engine

This is the reciprocal. If OC ranges from 2 to 4 engines per body, then it's 1/4 to 1/2 bodies per engine.

**Answer: (D)** between 2 and 4 car bodies per engine

---

### Problem 6: NOT on Joint Transformation Curve

**Joint transformation curve calculation:**

**Max engines (0 bodies):**
- Both produce engines: 75 + 60 = 135 engines
- Point: **(0, 135)** ✓ Option A

**Gottlieb switches to bodies:**
- Gottlieb: 30 bodies, 0 engines
- Carl: 0 bodies, 75 engines
- Point: **(30, 75)** ✓ Option C

**Optimal point from Problem 4:**
- 39 bodies, 39 engines (not 50!)
- Point: **(39, 39)** 

**Testing option B: (10, 115)**
- 10 bodies from Gottlieb uses: 10 × 10 = 100 days
- Remaining: 200 days → 200/5 = 40 engines
- Carl: all engines → 75 engines
- Total engines: 40 + 75 = 115 ✓ Works!

**Testing option D: (39, 50)**
- If making 39 complete vehicles, would have 39 engines, not 50
- This point is NOT efficient

**Answer: (D)** 39 car bodies and 50 engines

---

**Summary:** These problems reinforce comparative advantage principles with composite goods. The key insight is that specialization based on comparative advantage maximizes joint output, even when making complex products requiring multiple components.
