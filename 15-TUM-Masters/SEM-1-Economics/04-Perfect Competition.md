**Topic:** Exercise 4 - Competitive Markets  
**Difficulty:** Advanced Level

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### 1. Perfect Competition Characteristics

**Definition:** Market structure with many buyers and sellers where no single agent can influence price.

**Five Key Assumptions:**

1. **Many small firms:** Each firm is a price taker
2. **Homogeneous product:** Perfect substitutes
3. **Free entry and exit:** No barriers
4. **Perfect information:** All agents know prices and quality
5. **No transaction costs:** Frictionless trading

---

### 2. Firm Behavior (Price Taker)

**Price-taking assumption:**

- Firm faces horizontal demand curve at market price $p$
- Can sell any quantity at market price
- Cannot influence price

**Profit maximization:** $$\max_q \pi = pq - C(q)$$

**First-order condition:** $$p = MC(q)$$

**Key insight:** Price taker produces where price equals marginal cost.

---

### 3. Short-Run Equilibrium

**Individual firm:**

- Produces where $p = MC(q)$
- May earn positive, zero, or negative economic profit
- Shuts down if $p < \min AVC$

**Market equilibrium:**

- Supply equals demand: $Q^S(p) = Q^D(p)$
- Market supply: $Q^S = n \cdot q^S(p)$ (sum of individual supplies)
- Equilibrium price clears market

**Profit in short run:** $$\pi = pq - C(q) = q[p - AC(q)]$$

Can be positive, zero, or negative.

---

### 4. Long-Run Equilibrium ⭐

**Key difference:** Free entry and exit

**Entry/exit dynamics:**

- If $\pi > 0$: New firms enter → supply increases → price falls
- If $\pi < 0$: Firms exit → supply decreases → price rises
- Process continues until $\pi = 0$

**Long-run equilibrium conditions:**

1. Each firm: $p = MC(q)$ (profit maximization)
2. Each firm: $p = AC(q)$ (zero profit)
3. Market: $Q^D(p) = Q^S(p)$ (supply = demand)

**Combined:** $p^* = MC(q^_) = AC(q^_)$

**Key insight:** Long-run equilibrium occurs at minimum average cost!

---

### 5. Finding Long-Run Equilibrium

**Step-by-step procedure:**

**Step 1: Find efficient scale (minimum AC)**

Set $MC = AC$: $$MC(q) = AC(q)$$

Solve for $q^*$ (efficient scale of production)

**Step 2: Find long-run price** $$p^* = MC(q^_) = AC(q^_)$$

This is minimum average cost.

**Step 3: Find total quantity**

From demand: $$Q^D(p^_) = Q^_$$

**Step 4: Find number of firms** $$n^* = \frac{Q^_}{q^_}$$

Each firm produces at efficient scale.

---

### 6. Welfare Analysis

**Consumer Surplus (CS):** $$CS = \int_0^{Q^_} [P^D(q) - p^_] dq$$

For linear demand $P^D = a - bQ$: $$CS = \frac{1}{2} \times Q^* \times (a - p^*)$$

**Producer Surplus (PS):** $$PS = \int_0^{Q^_} [p^_ - MC(q)] dq$$

**In long-run perfect competition:** $PS = 0$

- Since $p^* = AC(q^*)$, firms earn zero economic profit
- All surplus goes to consumers!

**Total Surplus:** $$TS = CS + PS$$

---

### 7. Market Interventions

#### Price Ceiling (Maximum Price)

**Set at $\bar{p} < p^*$:**

- Quantity demanded: $Q^D(\bar{p}) > Q^*$
- Quantity supplied: $Q^S(\bar{p}) < Q^*$
- **Shortage:** $Q^D - Q^S$
- **Deadweight loss:** Trades that would benefit both parties don't occur

**If $\bar{p} < \min AC$:**

- No firm can cover costs
- **Market shuts down completely!**
- Quantity supplied = 0
- Maximum welfare loss

---

#### Price Floor (Minimum Price)

**Set at $\underline{p} > p^*$:**

- Quantity demanded: $Q^D(\underline{p}) < Q^*$
- Quantity supplied: $Q^S(\underline{p}) > Q^*$
- **Surplus:** $Q^S - Q^D$
- **Deadweight loss:** Potential trades don't occur

**If $\underline{p} < p^*$:**

- **Non-binding constraint**
- Market operates at equilibrium
- No welfare loss

---

#### Per-Unit Tax (on producers)

**Tax of $t$ per unit:**

**New firm problem:** $$\max_q pq - C(q) - tq$$

**FOC:** $p = MC(q) + t$

**Interpretation:** Firm acts as if marginal cost is $MC + t$

**Long-run effects:**

- Equilibrium price: $p^* = MC(q^_) + t = AC_{\text{new}}(q^_)$
- Efficient scale may change
- Fewer firms (higher costs → less output)
- **Tax incidence:** Shared between consumers and producers
- **Deadweight loss:** $DWL = \frac{1}{2} \times \Delta Q \times t$

---

#### Lump-Sum Subsidy

**Subsidy $S$ per firm:**

**New cost:** $C(q) - S$ for $q > 0$

**New average cost:** $$AC_{\text{new}}(q) = \frac{C(q) - S}{q}$$

**Effect:**

- Lower average costs
- More firms can enter
- Lower equilibrium price
- Higher total quantity
- **Each firm still earns zero profit** (long run)

---

### 8. Comparative Statics

**Effect of demand increase (higher $a$ in $Q^D = a - p$):**

- Short run: Price rises, quantity rises, firms earn positive profit
- Long run: Entry occurs, price returns to min AC, more firms

**Effect of cost reduction (lower fixed costs):**

- Short run: Existing firms earn higher profit
- Long run: Entry occurs, more firms, lower price, zero profit restored

**Effect of technology improvement (lower MC):**

- Long run: Lower min AC → lower price, higher quantity
- More total output, possibly fewer or more firms depending on scale

## 📐 Common Cost Functions

### Quadratic with Fixed Costs: $C(q) = c_f + q^2$

**Marginal cost:** $MC(q) = 2q$

**Average cost:** $AC(q) = \frac{c_f}{q} + q$

**Efficient scale:** Set $MC = AC$ $$2q = \frac{c_f}{q} + q$$ $$q^* = \sqrt{c_f}$$

**Minimum AC:** $p^* = 2\sqrt{c_f}$

---

### Linear + Quadratic: $C(q) = c_f + cq + dq^2$

**Marginal cost:** $MC(q) = c + 2dq$

**Average cost:** $AC(q) = \frac{c_f}{q} + c + dq$

**Efficient scale:** Set $MC = AC$ $$c + 2dq = \frac{c_f}{q} + c + dq$$ $$dq = \frac{c_f}{q}$$ $$q^* = \sqrt{\frac{c_f}{d}}$$

**Minimum AC:** $p^* = c + 2\sqrt{dc_f}$

## 🔍 Problem-Solving Framework

### Finding Long-Run Equilibrium

**Template:**

1. **Calculate MC and AC**
    
    - $MC(q) = \frac{dC}{dq}$
    - $AC(q) = \frac{C(q)}{q}$
2. **Find efficient scale:** Set $MC = AC$, solve for $q^*$
    
3. **Find equilibrium price:** $p^* = MC(q^_) = AC(q^_)$
    
4. **Find total quantity:** $Q^* = Q^D(p^*)$
    
5. **Find number of firms:** $n^* = \frac{Q^_}{q^_}$
    
6. **Verify zero profit:** $\pi = p^* \cdot q^* - C(q^*) = 0$ ✓

### Welfare Calculations

**Consumer Surplus (linear demand):** $$CS = \frac{1}{2} \times Q \times (P_{\text{max}} - p)$$

Where $P_{\text{max}}$ is demand intercept (price when $Q = 0$).

**Producer Surplus in long run:** $$PS = 0$$

Always zero due to free entry/exit!

**Deadweight Loss from intervention:** $$DWL = \frac{1}{2} \times |Q_1 - Q_0| \times |p_1 - p_0|$$

Triangle between supply and demand curves.

## 💡 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Thinking firms earn positive profit in long run**

- Free entry/exit → zero economic profit always

❌ **Forgetting producer surplus is zero in long run**

- All gains go to consumers in perfect competition

❌ **Not checking if price ceiling is binding**

- If ceiling < min AC, market may shut down completely

❌ **Confusing short run and long run**

- Short run: fixed number of firms, profit can be non-zero
- Long run: free entry/exit, zero profit

❌ **Wrong welfare calculations**

- Must use triangular areas carefully
- Price ceiling: measure loss relative to equilibrium

❌ **Ignoring integer constraints on number of firms**

- In practice, $n$ must be whole number
- May lead to small positive or negative profits

## 🎓 Key Insights

1. **Long-run price = Minimum average cost**
    
    - This is the most efficient production scale
    - Consumers get lowest possible price
2. **Zero economic profit ≠ zero accounting profit**
    
    - Economic profit includes opportunity costs
    - Firms still earn normal return on capital
3. **All gains go to consumers in long run**
    
    - Producer surplus = 0
    - Perfect competition maximizes consumer welfare
4. **Free entry is crucial**
    
    - Without it, firms could earn positive profits
    - Entry pressure keeps prices down
5. **Interventions create deadweight loss**
    
    - Price ceilings: too little produced
    - Price floors: too much produced
    - Taxes: reduce quantity traded
6. **Market automatically finds efficient scale**
    
    - No central planner needed
    - Entry/exit adjusts to optimal firm size
7. **Per-unit taxes reduce output, lump-sum don't**
    
    - Per-unit: affects marginal decision
    - Lump-sum: only affects entry decision, not output per firm

## 📋 Quick Reference

**Long-run equilibrium:**

- $p = MC(q) = AC(q)$
- $\pi = 0$
- $n = Q^D(p) / q$

**Welfare:**

- $CS = \frac{1}{2}Q(P_{\max} - p)$
- $PS = 0$ (long run)
- $DWL = \frac{1}{2}|Q_1 - Q_0||p_1 - p_0|$

**With tax $t$:**

- $p = MC(q) + t$
- Output decreases
- $n$ decreases

**Integer constraint:**

- If $n^*$ not integer, check adjacent values
- With $n$: might have positive profit (attracts entry)
- With $n+1$: might have losses (causes exit)
