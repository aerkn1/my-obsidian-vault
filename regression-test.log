=== SCENARIO 1: No local changes, new remote commits ===
Before open script - clean working dir:
On branch obsidian-2025-06-26
Your branch is behind 'origin/obsidian-2025-06-26' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	regression-test.log
	test-regression.sh

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
ls: test-remote-change.md: No such file or directory
Running open script...
